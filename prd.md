## 6. Narrative
Sarah opens her laptop with her morning coffee, navigating to her bookmark for Daily Word Challenge. The interface loads instantlyâ€”no ads, no login prompts, just today's empty puzzle grid waiting for her. She types "CRANE" as her opening guess, a strategy she's developed over weeks of play. The letters flip to reveal one yellow and one green, and she smiles, knowing she's off to a good start.

Four guesses later, she solves "SWEPT" and watches her statistics update: 89% success rate, 4.2 average guesses, current streak of 12 days. She smiles and moves on to a daily news site, already looking forward to tomorrow's challenge, grateful for the two minutes of mental exercise that started her day without frustration or distraction.
